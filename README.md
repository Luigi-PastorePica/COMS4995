The intention is to create a simple personal finance tool for saving money when repaying debt. This application would allow to keep track of credits and loans, their interest rates, how much is still owed, mothly minimums, etc. Such data will be used to calculate and recommend which debt to pay more than the minimum at that particular time and how much to pay over the minimum. 

The idea is that the user can clearly see which debt is more beneficial to pay more aggressively first (and up to what amount) in order to save money in the long term.

This is a relatively simple process with a few debts, but it becomes tedious when taking into account several debts.
